## Hash Tables

## Performance 🚀
<pre>
* insert(item)  - O(1)
* Lookup()      - O(1)
* Delete()      - O(1)
</pre>
## When to use 🤔
when we want to lookups for some value


## Notes 📝
* Real world example:
  * Spell checkers
  * Dictionaries
  * Compilers
  * Code editors
* Some programming languages has support Hash Tables but under different names.
  * Java - HashMap
  * JavaScript/TypeScript - Object
  * Python - Dictionary
  * C# - Dictionary

<br />
* Hash Tables store <b><i>KEY,VALUE</i></b> pair
* Basically in Hash Table, key will pass into hash function and it will gives the address that where should store that data in memory.
* Also when we want to lookup a value, key will pass into hash function and then we can get the address of that data instead of checking every value. 
* Hash Function is  <b><i>Deterministic </i></b> (when we input a value, it will gives the same value).


## Maps vs Sets 🚀
* Maps(K,V) can store duplicate values but Sets(K) does not allow to store duplicates.
* therefore we can use Maps for when we care about counts and we can use Sets when we do not care about counts.
