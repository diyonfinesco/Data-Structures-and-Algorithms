<pre>
* enqueue(item)  - O(1)
* dequeue()      - O(1)
* peek()         - O(1)

* isFull()       - O(1)
</pre>
## When to use 🤔
when know how many items we have


## Notes 📝
* implement undo features
* build compilers (eg: syntax checking)
* evaluate expressions (eg: 1 + 2 * 3)
* build navigation (forward/back)
* stacks not implemented for lookups

## Real world examples 👀
* Printers
* Operating Systems
