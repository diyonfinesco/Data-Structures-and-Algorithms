## Stack (LIFO - Last In  First Out)

## Performance 🚀
* push(item) - **O(1)**
* pop()      - **O(1)**
* peek()     - **O(1)**
* isEmpty()  - **O(1)**

## When to use 🤔
when know how many items we have


## Notes 📝
* implement undo features
* build compilers (eg: syntax checking)
* evaluate expressions (eg: 1 + 2 * 3)
* build navigation (forward/back)
* stacks not implemented for lookups
